# Hi👋,

### I'm Kader Arslan. Here I share the projects in my learning process while improving myself. My learning path is to learn while developing a project. Encountering bugs on projects and ultimately learning better. I aim to integrate the Kaizen technique into my life. With continuous improvement, I strive to open the difference between yesterday's me and tomorrow's me. My goal is to learn more. Apply while learning. Understanding the secret of the job while applying.
